Swift-OAuth-Vkontakte-NoSDK-Example
==========

Software demonstrates how to work with OAuth Apps, on the example of working with VK API: authorizing through VK app and using VK API methods.
Supported iOS from 11.2.

----------

Software is made for training purposes to learn how to correctly authorize in VK app, using the public protocol OAuth 2.0 to obtain the access key.
In this case, the user does not transfer the login and password to the application, so his account can not be compromised.
In addition, there are implemented some VK API methods, showing how to obtain the users list of friends, information about them and etc.
I didn't use VK iOS SDK, so you can see how to work with OAuth without any external frameworks or SDKs.
